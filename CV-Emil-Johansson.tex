\section{interests}
My interests include, but are not limited to, deep learning,
programming and software development, and quantum mechanics.

In my spare time I like to travel, read interesting articles and
tutorials, work on my programming projects, and
tinker with computers. An example is the Raspberry Pi that is running on
top of my closet. Currently it is  running a chat client, network wide ad-blocker, Kodi
media center, personal git repository, and personal file storage. Another is my
laptop running OpenSUSE and Emacs. The later I spend way to much time
customizing. Much of my programming skills originate from learning in
my spare time.

\section{other information}
Born in the small town of \"Almhult in Sm\aa land, moved to study
physics at Lund University in 2013.

The goal of my studies at Lund University is to train my ability to
learn independently, not to memorize facts and formulas. In an ever
changing world, the ability to quickly comprehend and analyze is more
important than ever. My grades are not spectacular as I never really
study specifically to pass exams, but to understand the
subject. However,

In ten years I see myself as the specialist, the guy to ask when there
is a problem in my area of expertise. I enjoy investigating abstract
constructions in depth using mathematics to understand them. After
graduation I am looking for positions in which I can gaining expertise
in the vibrant field of applying deep learning techniques in new areas.
