\section{other information}
Born in the small town of \"Almhult in Sm\aa land moved to study
physics at Lund University in 2013.

From my studies at Lund University I want to gain the ability to
understand new things not to memorize the facts taught by the
professors. In a ever and faster changing world the ability to quickly
comprehend and analyze is more important than ever. My grades are not
spectacular as I never really study specifically for the exams but
have not to this day failed a single examination. 

In ten years I see myself as the specialist, the guy everyone asks
about my area when there is a problem. I enjoy investigating abstract
construction in depth using mathematics to understand them. Although I
am not sure I want to be that person my entire career. Eventually I
want to develop the expertise to maybe start my own enterprise or take
more of a leadership role.
