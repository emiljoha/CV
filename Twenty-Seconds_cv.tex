\aboutme{
Mathematical Physicist with a passion for Software Engineering on the
Emacs side of the editor war.

From my studies at Lund University I want to gain the ability to
understand new things not to memorize the facts taught by the
professors. In a ever and faster changing world the ability to quickly
comprehend and analyze is more important than ever. My grades are not
spectacular as I never really study specifically for the exams but
have not to this day failed a single examination.

\section{other information}
Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a “poky little house,” and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
