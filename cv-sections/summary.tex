\cvparagraph{Summary}

I have an M.Sc in Mathematical Physics, and my interests include, but are not
limited to, Linux and open source software, cryptocurrencies, quantum
mechanics, and machine learning,. I have a year of experience in creating
novel deep learning applications in physics during which I received the
”NanoLund Junior Scientist Ideas Award”. At ÅF I have been working with the IT
security company Advenica, creating network segmentation solutions for
critical infrastructure. My current assignment is at a large international
undisclosed company developing in the backend using Scala, TypeScript, and
Python.

In my spare time, I like to go hiking, read interesting articles and
tutorials, work on private programming projects, and tinker with computers. An
example is a Raspberry Pi that is running a network-wide ad-blocker, Plex
media center, personal git repositories, and personal file storage. Many of my
skills originate from learning in my spare time.
