\cvparagraph{Summary}

Educated as a Physicist, employed as an Embedded Systems Software Developer,
currently working with Python, Scala, and Typescript as a Backend Software
Engineer. In my previous assignment I worked in Linux and C/C++ on network
segmentation solutions for critical infrastructure with the IT security
company Advenica.

In my spare time, I like to go hiking, read interesting articles and
tutorials, work on private programming projects, and tinker with computers. I
have a raspberry pi running a bunch of services like media server, git
repositories, and file hosting. Many of my skills originate from learning in
my spare time. My natural habitat is in Linux creating exiting things with
C/C++ and Python.

Recently I have grown more and more interested in concepts like continuous
integration. This CV is for exampled automatically built using docker in a
GitHub action and then if successfully built, published
to \url{https://cv.emijoh.se}.
