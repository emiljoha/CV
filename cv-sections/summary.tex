\cvparagraph{Summary}

Educated as a Physicist, employed as an embedded systems software developer
consultant, actually working with Scala, Typescript, and Python to be run
mainly on clusters for a large international company in Hyllie. In my previous
assignment I was creating network segmentation solutions for critical
infrastructure with the IT security company Advenica.

My master thesis was to teach a neural network quantum mechanics. I learned a
lot of lessons the hard way but got the ”NanoLund Junior Scientist Ideas
Award” in the process.

In my spare time, I like to go hiking, read interesting articles and
tutorials, work on private programming projects, and tinker with computers. I
have a raspberry pi running a bunch of services like media server, git
repositories, and file hosting. Many of my skills originate from learning in
my spare time.

Working with software a while I have grown more interested in concepts like
continuous integration and continuous delivery. This CV is for exampled
automatically built using docker in a GitHub action and then if successfully
built, published to \url{https://cv.emijoh.se/resume.pdf}.
