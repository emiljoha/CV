\cvparagraph{Summary}

Educated as a Physicist, employed as an embedded systems software developer,
actually working with Scala, Typescript, and Python to be run on clusters and
in browsers for a large international company in Hyllie. In my previous
assignment I was creating network segmentation solutions for critical
infrastructure with the IT security company Advenica.

My master thesis was to try and teach a neural network quantum mechanics. I
learned a lot of lessons the hard way but got the ”NanoLund Junior Scientist
Ideas Award” in the process.

In my spare time, I like to go hiking, read interesting articles and
tutorials, work on private programming projects, and tinker with computers. An
example is a Raspberry Pi that is running a network-wide ad-blocker, Plex
media center, personal git repositories, and personal file storage. Many of my
skills originate from learning in my spare time.
